# USP313_Proj_DigitalMeter
The Project was done by:
Yash Maharaj, 
Valraj Singh, 
Shivneet Kumar and, 
Kritish Singh. 
Year 2023. Semester 1. Laucala Campus.
The Project was a course requirement at the University of the 
South Pacific EE313: Microprocessor Application.
###################################
PIC model: PIC 18F8722 Microcontroller
Ultrasonic Sensor model: HC-SR04

An alternate design to using the YF-S201 water flow sensor was considered for the Ultrasonic sensor. However, it was scraped due to the addition of complicated interrupt usage and 
extraneous feature towards the project requirement.
YF-S201 water flow sensor solves the problem of accurately measuring variable depth, width and truncated buckets.
###################################
This Project essentially uses the pic microcontroller, ultrasonic sensors, number keypad to make a digital meter that can 
1) Measure Anyone's Height
2) Measure the amount of liquid in any given bucket( Radius and Height must be known), and at 60% capacity filled it will start beeping, at 80% capacity filled the frequency of beeps will increase and at 95% the beep frequency will be constant noise.
